arima fits both standard ARIMA models that are autoregressive in the dependent variable and
structural models with ARMA disturbances. Good introductions to the former models can be found in
Box, Jenkins, and Reinsel (2008); Hamilton (1994); Harvey (1993); Newton (1988); Diggle (1990);
and many others. The latter models are developed fully in Hamilton (1994) and Harvey (1989), both of
which provide extensive treatment of the Kalman filter (Kalman 1960) and the state-space form used
by arima to fit the models. Becketti (2013) discusses ARIMA models and Stata’s arima command,
and he devotes an entire chapter explaining how the principles of ARIMA models are applied to real
datasets in practice

For stationary series, full or unconditional maximum likelihood estimates are obtained via the
Kalman filter. For nonstationary series, if some prior information is available, you can specify initial
values for the filter by using state0() and p0() as suggested by Hamilton (1994) or assume an
uninformative prior by using the diffuse option as suggested by Harvey (1989). Consider a first-order autoregressive moving-average process. Then arima estimates all the parameters in the model where: 

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            ρ is the first-order autocorrelation parameter
          </li>
          <li>
            θ is the first-order moving-average parameter
          </li>
          <li>
            Et is a white noise disturbance. 
          </li>
        </ul>

      <article>
        <p>Pure ARIMA models without a structural component do not have regressors and are often written
            as autoregressions in the dependent variable, rather than autoregressions in the disturbances from a
            structural equation</p>
  
        <ul>
          <li>
            In one way, the results differ from most of Stata’s estimation commands: the standard error of
            the coefficients is reported as OPG Std. Err. The default standard errors and covariance matrix
            for arima estimates are derived from the outer product of gradients (OPG). This is one of three
            asymptotically equivalent methods of estimating the covariance matrix of the coefficients (only two of
            which are usually tractable to derive).</li>
          <li>Discussions and derivations of all three estimates can be found
            in Davidson and MacKinnon (1993), Greene (2012), and Hamilton (1994). Bollerslev, Engle, and
            Nelson (1994) suggest that the OPG estimates are more numerically stable in time-series regressions
            when the likelihood and its derivatives depend on recursive computations, which is certainly the case
            for the Kalman filter.</li>
          <li>
            To date, we have found no numerical instabilities in either estimate of the
            covariance matrix—subject to the stability and convergence of the overall model. Most of Stata’s estimation commands provide covariance estimates derived from the Hessian of
            the likelihood function. These alternate estimates can also be obtained from arima by specifying the
            vce(oim) option.

      <header>Multiplicative seasonal ARIMA models</header>
      <article>
        <p>
            Many time series exhibit a periodic seasonal component, and a seasonal ARIMA model, often
            abbreviated SARIMA, can then be used. For example, monthly sales data for air conditioners have a
            strong seasonal component, with sales high in the summer months and low in the winter months.
        </p>
  
        <p>
            In the notation (1, 1, 1) × (0, 0, 1)4, the (1, 1, 1) means that there is one nonseasonal autoregressive
            term (1 − ρ1L) and one nonseasonal moving-average term (1 + θ1L) and that the time series is
            first-differenced one time. The (0, 0, 1)4 indicates that there is no lag-4 seasonal autoregressive term,
            that there is one lag-4 seasonal moving-average term (1 + θ4,1L
            4
            ), and that the series is seasonally
            differenced zero times. This is known as a multiplicative SARIMA model because the nonseasonal
            and seasonal factors work multiplicatively: (1 + θ1L)(1 + θ4,1L
            4
            ). Multiplying the terms imposes
            nonlinear constraints on the parameters of the fifth-order lagged values; arima imposes these constraints
            automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unless diffuse is used, arima must create square matrices of dimension {max(p, q+1)}
            2
            , where
            p and q are the maximum AR and MA lags, respectively; and the inclusion of long seasonal terms can
            make this dimension rather large. For example, with monthly data, you might fit a (0, 1, 1)×(0, 1, 2)12
            SARIMA model. The maximum MA lag is 2 × 12 + 1 = 25, requiring a matrix with 262 = 676 rows
            and columns

      <article>
        Thus far all our examples have been pure ARIMA models in which the dependent variable was
        modeled solely as a function of its past values and disturbances. Also, arima can fit ARMAX models,
        which model the dependent variable in terms of a linear combination of independent variables, as
        well as an ARMA disturbance process. The prais command (see [TS] prais), for example, allows
        you to control for only AR(1) disturbances, whereas arima allows you to control for a much richer
        dynamic error structure. arima allows for both nonseasonal and seasonal ARMA components in the
        disturbances. The code is:
        <code
          >arima consump m2 if tin(, 1981q4), ar(1) ma(1);
        </code>
  
        We will restrict the estimation to the desired sample by using the tin() function in an if
        expression; see [D] functions. By leaving the first argument of tin() blank, we are including all
        available data through the second date (1981q4). 
      </article>

    <section class="main-section" id="Dynamic_forecasting">
      <header>Dynamic forecasting</header>
      <p>
        Another feature of the arima command is the ability to use predict afterward to make dynamic
        forecasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we use regress or prais to fit the model, then we can use predict to make one-step-ahead
        forecasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, here predict will use the actual value of y at period f − 1 in computing the
        forecast for time f. Thus, if we use regress or prais, we cannot make forecasts for any periods
        beyond f = T + 1 unless we have observed values for y for those periods.

        Estimation is by maximum likelihood using the Kalman filter via the prediction error decomposition;
        see Hamilton (1994), Gourieroux and Monfort (1997), or, in particular, Harvey (1989). Any of these
        sources will serve as excellent background for the fitting of these models with the state-space form;
        each source also provides considerable detail on the method outlined below:<p>
          With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
          can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kalman filter recursions: To demonstrate how missing data are handled, the updating recursions for the Kalman filter will
            be left in two steps. Writing the updating equations as one step using the gain matrix K is common.
            We will provide the updating equations with little justification; see the sources listed above for details.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Kalman filter initial conditions: If the series is not stationary, the initial state conditions do not constitute a random draw from a
            stationary distribution, and some other values must be chosen. Hamilton (1994) suggests that they be
            chosen based on prior expectations, whereas Harvey suggests a diffuse and improper prior having a
            state vector of 0 and an infinite variance. This method corresponds to P1|0 with diagonal elements of
            ∞. Stata allows either approach to be taken for nonstationary series—initial priors may be specified
            with state0() and p0(), and a diffuse prior may be specified with diffuse.
